# Amazon order exporting tool for sellers.

> This extension automates several steps needed to get all orders (including customer ID and order ID).
> Amazon sellers often go to [Amazon Orders Page](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/gp/orders-v2/list) and check orders by using some search options and pagination. Also exporting something like ASIN, cust-id and order-id will be needed, but it's a kind of time consuming job because those info was hidden as hidden input field in table. So I created this BOT to get all order info through pagination.
